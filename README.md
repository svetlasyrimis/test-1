# Crazy Eights Simulator

---

## Project Usage

Crazy Eights Simulator is a card game simulator that allows the user to play a game of Crazy Eight's.  The game is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The user and opponet are both dealt five cards. the rest of the deck is left on the table with one card from the dark turned over.  The user and opponent take turns trying to accumulate points by getting rid of a card from their set that matches the suit or number of the overturned card. The user will play against the simulator as the only opponent.  New games can be started through a refresh option.

## API

I plan on using a card deck API [API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/).  I plan to use all the data included in the API to meet MVP. Data includes methods for drawing cards, shuffling cards, adding, drawing, and listing cards in piles.

## Features
